Define a custom PyTorch dataset class RichXMLDataset to ingest shredded XML insurance policy data, extracting structured features such as premium amount, age, term length, and risk score. 

Normalize the numerical features using StandardScaler, and encode policy types as class labels using LabelEncoder. 
Use a basic Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model built with nn.Module to classify the policies into multiple categories. 
Load the data with PyTorch DataLoader objects, split into training and validation sets, and train the model over multiple epochs while monitoring classification performance on the validation set.
